## What’s New in v4.0.45

Version 4.0.45 focuses on hardening timing logic, modernizing the build surface, and pruning legacy complexity to pave the way for higher‑velocity feature work.

### Reliability Fixes

- Random interval execution logic corrected—delays now honor configured entropy without drifting.
- Alert parsing hardening reduces false error states when scanning dynamic pages.

### Platform Modernization

- Migration toward **Vite + Nx** consolidates scripts, speeds cold builds, and shrinks incremental rebuild times.
- Refined Codacy exclusion rules keep static analysis signal high while cutting noise.

### UX Polish

- Subscription modal refreshed with improved hierarchy, reducing funnel friction for upgrades.

### Why It Matters

The extension now launches faster under development, consumes fewer CI minutes, and yields more predictable automation timing—critical for multi‑step form flows.

Tip: If you chain random intervals, re‑export your configuration after saving to ensure deterministic ordering.
