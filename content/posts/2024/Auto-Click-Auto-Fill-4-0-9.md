## What’s New in v4.0.9

Focus continues on progressive onboarding and infrastructure readiness.

### Added

- Guided tour version gate (avoids redundant replays).
- “Suppress What’s New” toggle for quieter updates.
- Firebase OAuth + Firestore library integration laying groundwork for future sync / cloud enrichments.

### Technical Foundation

Early type exposure for OAuth helpers introduced to shared library—accelerates downstream feature iteration.

Pro Tip: If you disabled tours but want them back, reset onboarding flags via settings.
