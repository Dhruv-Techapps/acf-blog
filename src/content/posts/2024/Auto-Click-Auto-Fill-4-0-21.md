## What’s New in v4.0.21

This release enhances onboarding control and reduces repetitive UI friction.

### Feature Additions

- Version‑aware **guided tour check** prevents re‑showing tutorials after tool updates.
- Added **“Suppress What’s New”** option—lets power users jump straight back to work.
- Internal version constant alignment (`NX_RELEASE_VERSION`) across extension surfaces for predictable telemetry & gating.

### Why It Matters

Less interruption = higher adoption of deeper automation recipes.
