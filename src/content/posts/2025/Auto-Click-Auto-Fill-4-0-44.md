## What’s New in v4.0.44

Release 4.0.44 refactors event dispatching, strengthens cross‑frame automation, and expands language coverage—especially for East Asian locales.

### Event & Frame Handling

- Improved handling for actions added after Goto steps, preventing UI desync.
- Safer event propagation in environments where iframe elements are dynamically detached or lack `src` attributes.

### Localization & Accessibility

- Broadened Chinese & Korean translation updates ensure terminology consistency across record, value, and condition panels.

### Dependency Hygiene

Targeted upgrades reduce transitive risk and modernize core libs, helping keep browser compatibility tight.

### Developer Notes

Refinements here unlock future batching of cross‑frame actions without race conditions.
